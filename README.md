Projects: Mobile Data Analysis On PowerBI

Objective: To analyze various attributes of mobile phones, including operating systems, battery capacity, 5G availability, mobile brands, internal storage, and selfie camera specifications, to provide insights into the mobile market.

Key Metrics and KPIs:
1) Operating System Distribution: Measure the count and percentage of devices by operating system type.
2) Battery Capacity Analysis: Evaluate the distribution of battery capacity across different ranges to identify common capacities.
3) 5G Availability: Track the percentage of devices that support 5G technology versus those that do not.
4) Internal Storage Distribution: Analyze the distribution of internal storage sizes across devices, identifying the most common storage capacities.
5) Selfie Camera Quality: Assess the distribution of selfie camera megapixels, focusing on the most popular specifications.
6) Brand Distribution: Measure the count of devices by brand, providing insights into brand market share.

Visualization Techniques:
1) Clustered Column Chart: Used to analyze the distribution of mobile operating systems, providing a clear comparison between Android, iOS, Windows, and unspecified operating systems.
2) Donut Chart: Employed to visualize the battery capacity distribution, highlighting the prevalence of different battery sizes among the analyzed phones.
3) Table Chart: Used to display mobile brand names and their corresponding counts, offering a straightforward view of brand distribution.
4) Stacked Bar Chart: Utilized to analyze the availability of 5G technology across the mobile phones, distinguishing between supported and unsupported devices.
5) Line & Clustered Column Chart: Applied to analyze internal storage data, combining line and column visuals to show storage capacity distribution.
6) Pie Chart: Used to analyze selfie camera data, showing the distribution of different megapixel categories in a clear and concise manner.
7) Chart: Deployed to display the total count of mobile phones analyzed, providing a quick summary of the dataset size.

Insights:
1) Operating System Distribution: The analysis revealed a dominant presence of Android devices, followed by iOS, with a small number of Windows and unspecified devices.
2) Battery Capacity Trends: Most devices have a battery capacity between 4001mAh to 5000mAh, while a smaller proportion falls into other capacity ranges.
3) 5G Technology Adoption: A significant number of devices do not support 5G, indicating a potential market gap or area for future growth.
4) Internal Storage Insights: The majority of devices have 128GB of internal storage, followed by a notable portion with unspecified storage capacity.
5) Selfie Camera Analysis: The analysis provides a detailed view of selfie camera specifications, offering insights into consumer preferences for camera quality.
